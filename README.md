# Javascript-SDK-for-HCX-Participant-System-to-help-in-integrating-with-HCX
This is a solution for the statement Build Javascript SDK for HCX Participant System to help in integrating with HCX.

The commands I provided earlier are intended to be run in the command prompt or terminal, not directly in PowerShell. Here's how you can execute the commands in PowerShell:

1. Open the PowerShell application.
2. Navigate to the root directory of your project using the `cd` command. For example, if your project is located at `C:\Users\YourUsername\hcx-sdk`, you can run:
   ```
   cd C:\Users\YourUsername\hcx-sdk
   ```
3. Execute each command one by one in the PowerShell prompt:
   ```
   mkdir src
   mkdir src\encryption
   mkdir src\request
   mkdir src\participant
   echo $null >> src\index.js
   echo $null >> src\encryption\encryptionUtils.js
   echo $null >> src\request\requestParser.js
   echo $null >> src\request\requestGenerator.js
   echo $null >> src\participant\participantProcessor.js
   ```

These commands will create the necessary directories and empty files as required for your project.

After running these commands, you can proceed with editing the files and adding the provided code.


Here's a step-by-step guide along with the commands you need to run and the filenames for each step:

Step 1: **Project Setup**
1. Create a new project directory for your JavaScript SDK.
   ```
   mkdir hcx-sdk
   cd hcx-sdk
   ```

Step 2: **Initialize the Project**
1. Initialize the project using npm.
   ```
   npm init -y
   ```

Step 3: **Create Files and Folders**
1. Create the necessary file structure and files using the following commands:
   ```
   mkdir src
   mkdir src/encryption
   mkdir src/request
   mkdir src/participant
   touch src/index.js
   touch src/encryption/encryptionUtils.js
   touch src/request/requestParser.js
   touch src/request/requestGenerator.js
   touch src/participant/participantProcessor.js
   ```

Step 4: **Install Dependencies**
1. Install the necessary dependencies.
   ```
   npm install jwe-library
   ```

Step 5: **Update Files**
1. Open the project in your preferred code editor and update the files as follows:

   **src/index.js**:
   Copy and paste the code from the previous response.

   **src/encryption/encryptionUtils.js**:
   Copy and paste the code from the previous response.

   **src/request/requestParser.js**:
   Copy and paste the code from the previous response.

   **src/request/requestGenerator.js**:
   Copy and paste the code from the previous response.

   **src/participant/participantProcessor.js**:
   Copy and paste the code from the previous response.

Step 6: **SDK Initialization**
1. Update the `src/index.js` file with the necessary SDK initialization and configuration logic.
   You may need to add additional code to handle authentication, endpoints, and any other configuration settings required by the HCX system.

Step 7: **SDK Usage**
1. Create a new JavaScript file, e.g., `app.js`, in the root directory of your project.
   ```
   touch app.js
   ```
2. In `app.js`, import and use the SDK to process participant requests.
   ```javascript
   const hcxSDK = require('./src/index');

   // Initialize the SDK
   const sdk = hcxSDK.initialize({ /* configuration options */ });

   // Process participant request
   const requestData = {}; // Replace with actual request data
   const response = sdk.processParticipantRequest(requestData);

   // Handle the response as needed
   console.log(response);
   ```

Step 8: **Test the SDK**
1. Run the `app.js` file to test the SDK functionality.
   ```
   node app.js
   ```

That's it! You've completed the steps to set up the project, install dependencies, and implement the necessary files for the HCX JavaScript SDK. Adjust the configuration options, SDK logic, and filenames as needed based on the requirements of the HCX system and your project.

Remember to install any additional dependencies or libraries required by your specific implementation.

I hope this helps you get started with building your JavaScript SDK for integrating with HCX!
